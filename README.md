## Features

* See the list of planned command
* Add, edit, enable/disable or delete scheduled commands
* For each command, you have to define :

  * Based on Cron schedule expression see [Cron formats](https://abunchofutils.com/u/computing/cron-format-helper/)
  * Output Log file prefix (optional)
  * Priority (highest is priority)
* Run the Command immediately (at the next passage of the command `synolia:scheduler-run`)
* Run a Command juste one time (from history page clic on `Launch a command` button) 
* Download or live view of log files directly from the admin panel
* Define commands with a Factory (from a Doctrine migration, for example)

* Log into admin panel
* Click on `Scheduled commands` in the Scheduled commands section in main menu to manage your Scheduled commands
* Click on `Scheduled commands history` in the Scheduled commands section in main menu to see history of commands

## Fixtures
Inside sylius fixture file `config/packages/sylius_fixtures.yaml` you can add scheduled command fixtures to your suite.
```yaml
sylius_fixtures:
    suites:
        my_fixture_suite:
            fixtures:
                scheduler_command:
                    options:
                        scheduled_commands:
                            -
                                name: 'Reset Sylius'
                                command: 'sylius:fixtures:load'
                                cronExpression: '0 0 * * *'
                                logFilePrefix: 'reset'
                                priority: 0
                                enabled: true
                            -
                                name: 'Cancel Unpaid Orders'
                                command: 'sylius:cancel-unpaid-orders'
                                cronExpression: '0 0 * * *'
                                priority: 1
                                enabled: false
```

## Optional services
```yaml
services:
...
    # By enabling this service, it will be requested to vote after the other EveryMinuteIsDueChecker checker.
    # Using some cloud providers, even if the master cron is set to run every minute, it is actually not run that often
    # This service allows you to set a soft threshold limit, so if your provider is actually running the master cron every 5 minutes
    # This service will execute the cron if we are still in the threshold limit ONLY IF it was not already executed another time in the same range.
    #
    # CONFIGURATION SCENARIO: cron set to be run at 01:07 in the scheduler command plugin
    #
    # SCENARIO CASES AT 1 CRON PASS EVERY 5 MINUTES FROM THE PROVIDER
    # cron passes at 01:04 - 1..5 minutes: IS NOT DUE
    # cron passes at 01:05 - 1..5 minutes: IS NOT DUE
    # cron passes at 01:06 - 1..5 minutes: IS NOT DUE
    # cron passes at 01:07 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE (but it should already be handled by EveryMinuteIsDueChecker)
    # cron passes at 01:08 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE
    # cron passes at 01:09 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE #should not if another has started during the threshold period
    # cron passes at 01:10 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE #should not if another has started during the threshold period
    # cron passes at 01:11 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE #should not if another has started during the threshold period
    # cron passes at 01:12 - 1..5 minutes: IS DUE #should not if another has started during the threshold period
    # cron passes at 01:13 - 1..5 minutes: IS NOT DUE
    Synolia\SyliusSchedulerCommandPlugin\Checker\SoftLimitThresholdIsDueChecker:
        tags:
            - { name: !php/const Synolia\SyliusSchedulerCommandPlugin\Checker\IsDueCheckerInterface::TAG_ID }
        #optionnal, default value is 5 minutes
        arguments:
            $threshold: 5 #soft limit threshold in minutes
